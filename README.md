# senior-independent-project
A polling web app for a live audience. This website was used during a live, theatrical, choose-your-own-adventure play. 
As characters onstage needed to make decisions, the audience would vote and collectively choose the direction of the story.

Uses node.js, socket.io, html, css, skeleton.css, javascript, jquery
(Ignore the python) :)

The website is no longer live to save server costs since the show is no longer running.
